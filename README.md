## Monty Hall

The [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) is quite fun to think and it is fun to code up as well.

The output of the script is below, but I'd encourage everyone to try modeling this with code like `set(range(door_count)) - {chosen_door, revealed_door}`! Otherwise, [check out the code](https://github.com/mounicm/monty-hall/blob/master/run.py#L13-L21).

```
$ python3 run.py
66419 out of 100000 wins (66.419%) if you switch
33199 out of 100000 wins (33.199%) if you do not switch
```
